Introduction
============
This is just a really simple setup for getting started developing a client-side
web application using React. It has the following tools for quickly starting
something:

* Webpack
* Babel
* Sass
* React
* Normalize.scss

This is a barebones setup, meant to provide the minimal amount of configuration.
You can add to it with your favorite CSS framework, just by adding a few bits
and pieces to the default config. All of the packages are managed through NPM,
and Webpack makes it easy to include JavaScript and Sass right into your
application's .js files for maximum modularity.

Requirements
============

1. Install NPM according to your standard operating system practices.
2. Install webpack globally ```$ npm install -g webpack```
